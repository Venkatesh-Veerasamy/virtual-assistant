# virtual-assistant

|| This project establishes a user management system using Flask and SQLite. It begins with creating a virtual environment and installing required dependencies. An SQLite database is created with a users table, and sample user data is inserted while preventing duplicate emails. This setup serves as a strong foundation for developing additional web application features.||
